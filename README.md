# NetAlertSynX

`NetAlertSynX` is a sync service written in Swift using [Vapor][vapor], [Leaf][leaf] and [Fluent][fluent].

`NetAlertSynX` is built to provide a simple interface for managing syncs between `NetAlertSynX` and other services (like PFSense or ntopng).
While the best solution to extend `NetAlertSynX` functionality would be to integrate it with other systems and use its interfaces, I started this project as foundational learning project for Swift server-side development.

The interface of `NetAlertSynX` is based on the templating using [Leaf][leaf], and the persistency is based on a simple SQLite using [Fluent][fluent].
